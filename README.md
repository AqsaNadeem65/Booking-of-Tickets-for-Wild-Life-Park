# Booking-of-Tickets-for-Wild-Life-Park
A program is needed to allow a Wildlife Park to sell tickets. A booking consists of one or more
tickets for the same day(s) and can be made up to a week in advance. A booking can be made
for a visit of one day or two consecutive days. A booking can have extra attractions included. A
booking will be valid for the day(s) chosen only.
Task 1 – displaying the ticket options and the extra attractions available
Set up your program to:
display the options, attractions and prices for one-day tickets
display the options, attractions and prices for two-day tickets
show the days available for booking; assume that there are tickets available for any valid
day.
Task 2 – process a booking
Extend your program for Task 1 to:
input the tickets and extra attractions required, then calculate the total cost of the booking
allocate a unique booking number
display the booking details, including the total cost and the unique booking number repeat
as required.
Task 3 – ensuring each booking is the best value
Check that the total for each booking gives the best value and offer an alternative if this is not
the case. For example, buying two family tickets is better than a group ticket for a group of 10
that includes four adults and six children.
